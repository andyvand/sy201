Reminders

Tuesday, 04 Sep, is a Monday schedule. We'll have our class in NI227.

Readings

By Tuesday, 04 Sep, Read Liang, sections 5.5 through 5.6 (Nested Loops). I've
placed the code for Checkpoint 5.11 (on p. 146) in
~/repo/classwork/cw08/nestedLoops-20180904.py. Copy the file from the repo to a
location of your choosing. It's a collection of loops and is setup so you can
un-comment and run individual sections of code. Before Tuesday try to manually
predict the output of each loop in Checkpoint 5.11, then run the code to check
your answers.
