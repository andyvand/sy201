# NOTE: This file contains the commenting template I want you to use for the
# assignments you submit.  The "header" must include the following mandatory
# fields: Author; Alpha; Assignment; Date; Description; Resources.  The
# Description field is free-form.  Give me an overview, in your own words, of
# what your program does.  Resources should include not only internet resources,
# but collaboration with classmates, MGSP, etc.
# 
# The rest of the template may be adjusted or omitted as necessary, depending on
# the structure of your program. Make liberal use of in-line comments throughout
# your code to describe its function. Also make effective use of spacing and
# separators to give your code a clean, consistent, easy-to-read look.
