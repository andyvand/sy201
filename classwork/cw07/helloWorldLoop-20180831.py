# For loops can be used to iterate (loop over) many difference data types.
# Variables of these types are said to be "iterable".  From the python3
# documentation:

# Iterable: An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples
# of iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple) and
# some non-sequence types.  Iterables can be used in a for loop and in many
# other places where a sequence is needed (zip(), map(), â€¦).

for c in "Hello World":
   print(c)
