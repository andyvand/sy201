You're our only hope!

We intercepted the Imperial communication included with this message.  It
contains critical information about The Empire's order of battle and force
strength, but we're at a loss for how to decode it.  Our rebel base on Yavin was
able to garner the following intelligence, which may be helpful:

- We believe the file was encoded using the classic Imperial "marker" technique.
  A special ASCII character, called the marker, is used to identify where the
  plain text is within the code.  For every marker you encounter, the character
  that immediately follows it is the next character in the plain text message.
  Collecting all the characters and putting them together will crack the code.
  The problem is, we don't know which character the Empire is using as the
  marker.  A technique we've had luck with in the past is to analyze the
  frequency of occurrence of all the printable characters in the encoded file,
  and the one that shows up most frequently is usually the marker.

- Our agent Ahsoka Tano on Yavin intercepted an Imperial Stormtrooper
  transmission.  She was able to determine that the Empire is now using the
  extended ASCII character set to encode all its messages, so characters with
  ASCII values in the range from 0 up to 255 are all candidates.  She also
  discovered that the Imperial Army will try to obscure the ciphertext by mixing
  in non-printable characters.  If you examine the ciphertext in an editor, it
  may look very bizarre. Even so, Agent Tano indicates that markers will always
  be printable characters, so any frequency analysis that is conducted should
  focus only on printable ASCII characters.

During the Imperial AT-AT attack on our rebel base on Hoth, our computing
capability was severely damaged.  We don't have the power needed to conduct a
complete analysis of the encoded message and we need your help.

The Rebel Alliance is depending on you.

Good luck and may The Force be with you!
